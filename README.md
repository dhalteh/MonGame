I created an R simulator that performs a given number of turns and repetitions between a predefined number of players, and then ultimately tracks the frequency of pieces landing upon each of the game board's respective 40 spaces. 

This particular example demonstrates a one-on-one game comprised of 150 turns, repeated 1000 times.
